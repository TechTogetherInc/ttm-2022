            "description": "I've been to a lot of hackathons, but I've never used the cloud in any of my projects. Why? Because it always seemed too complicated and scary to tackle during a hackathon.This workshop is designed to help you conquer those fears by answering the following questions: What is the cloud? How can I use it in my hackathon project? What types of projects can I create with cloud technology? What free resources are available to help me get started? What if I get stuck? Use the skills you learn in this workshop at one of TechTogether's upcoming hackathons. This workshop is co-hosted with Microsoft, TechTogether's official Cloud Partner of our 2021-2022 hackathon season.",
